## Arrays
* **Maximum difference**: We are given an array of integers. We need to find out maximum value of ```arr[j]-arr[i]``` such that ```j>i```.     
  I/P: ```[2,3,10,6,4,8,1]```     
  O/P: ```8``` 
* **Leaders in an array**
* **Move zeros to the end**
* **Left rotate the Array by D places**
* **Trapping Rain Water**: Given the N non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.  
  I/P: ```[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]```   
  O/P: ```6``` 
* **Maximum consecutive 1's in a binary Array**: Count maximum consecutive 1's in a given binary array.   
  I/P: ```[1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]```   
  O/P: ```4```

  I/P: ```[8,3,4,8,8]```   
  O/P: ```8```   
* **Max sum of K consecutive elements**: Given an array of integers and a number K, find the maximum sum of K consecutive elements  
  I/P: ```[1,8,30,-5,20,7]```, K=```3```     
  O/P: ```45```   
* **Find subarray with given sum**: Given an unsorted array of non-negative integers. Find if there is a subarray with given sum 
  I/P: ```[1,4,20,3,10,5]```, Sum=```33```   
  O/P: ```Yes``` [20,3,10]   


## To Do
