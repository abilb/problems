## Arrays
* **Maximum difference**: We are given an array of integers. We need to find out maximum value of ```arr[j]-arr[i]``` such that ```j>i```    
  I/P: ```[2,3,10,6,4,8,1]```     
  O/P: ```8``` 
* **Leaders in an array**
* **Move zeros to the end**
* **Left rotate the Array by D places**
* **Trapping Rain Water**: Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.  
  I/P: ```[0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]```   
  O/P: ```6``` 


## To Do
* Add time/space complexity for solutions
* Add missing unit tests for some solutions
* Add description for questions
